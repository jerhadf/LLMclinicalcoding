# Project Title

## Introduction
For this project, we aim to de-risk and research the technical and strategic aspects of a key opportunity hypothesis: that Simwerx can build an effective automation solution for clinical coding in Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Here, we investigate ways to automate clinical coding with LLMs.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

## Deployment
Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system.
